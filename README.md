I've spent most of my adult, working life trying to track down bugs. Like every other developer out there, I spent hours trying to figure out edge cases to help get higher and higher test coverage percentages. And like most of you, I'm tired of it. With that in mind, I decided to build something to do the grunt work for me.

Mecha is a system to automatically test classes with the goal being to break the code. It can help with unit testing, security testing via data fuzzing, testing for concurrency issues, and check for fault tolerance. With one line of code, you can test every method in a class automatically.
